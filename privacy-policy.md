🔒 Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 23042025

LinkedIn Job Cleaner is a browser extension designed to enhance your job-search experience on LinkedIn by hiding promoted posts, filtering job types, and offering personalized filters like "Only Early Applicant Jobs."

Your privacy is important to us. This policy outlines what data we (don’t) collect, how it’s used, and your rights.

🔍 What Information We Collect
We do NOT collect or transmit any personal data.
The extension runs entirely in your browser. It does not access, store, or send:

Your LinkedIn login or account details

Personal data like your name, email, or job applications

Browsing history outside of LinkedIn

📦 What Data Is Stored
To enable features like toggles, filters, and stats tracking, we use Chrome's local extension storage (chrome.storage.sync). This data includes:

Whether hiding promoted jobs is enabled

Whether filtering for early applicant jobs is enabled

Your personal stats (e.g., number of jobs removed)

This data never leaves your device and is not shared or synced with any server we control.

🔐 Data Sharing
We do not share or sell your data with any third parties.
We do not use analytics, cookies, or tracking tools.

🧽 How to Clear Stored Data
You can reset your extension stats using the “Reset Stats” button in the popup.
You can also clear all stored data by uninstalling the extension or clearing browser extension storage via Chrome settings.

👶 Children’s Privacy
This extension is not intended for children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, especially minors.

⚖️ Changes to This Policy
If this extension evolves (e.g., adding cloud sync or a Pro version), we will update this policy and notify users via the Chrome Web Store page.
